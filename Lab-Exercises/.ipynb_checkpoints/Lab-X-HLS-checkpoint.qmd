## Overview

Today we are going to look at changes in vegetation greenness on the san Francisco peaks at the onset of fall and see if we can see a reduction of greenness as aspen start changing colors on the peaks.

We will look at Granule T12SVE for three dates:

* 2019 Sept 30  - HLS.S30 Sentinal 2A/2B- Julian Day 2019273
* 2019 October 5 - HLS.S30 Sentinal 2A/2B - Julian Day 2019278 (if time)
* 2019 October 9 - HLS.L30 Landsat 8/9- Julian Day 2019282

## **Step 1. Load First image**

* Open ENVI 6.0

* Once ENVI is Open, click *File > Open As > Generic Formats > TIFF*

* Navigate to the dataset and open the following file:

> Data Location: PATH **/HLS/FallColorPeaks/JD2019273_20190930**

> Filenames: **HLS.S30.T12SVE.2019273T181139.v2.0.B01** through **HLS.S30.T12SVE.2019273T181139.v2.0.B12**
